why spring:
popular framework
simper and lightweight alternative to J2EE
large number of helper classes. make things easier
get rid of EJB, former bad reputation.

New for Spring 5:
java 8 or higher
Upgrade Spring MVC to use new versions of Servlet API 4.0
Add new reactive programming framework: spring webFlux

Core Container: Beans:Core:SpEL:Context:

Infrastructure: AOP: Aspect Oriented Programming

Data Access Layer: JDBC ORM Transactions OXM JMS:Java message service

Web layer: Servlet, websocket, web ,porlet

Test layer: unit, integration, mock

Inversion of Control(IoC)
The approach of outsourcing the construction and management of objects.

Software Engineering Best Practice: code to an interface

Spring Container:
Primary functions:
1. Create and manager objects(Inversion of Control)
2. Inject object's dependencies(Dependency Injection)

Configuring Spring Container:
1. XML configuration file(legacy)
2. Java Annotations(modern)
3. Java Source Code(modern)
 
Spring Development Process
1. Configure ur spring Beans: treat the beans as java objects
2. Create a Spring Container: generically known as ApplicationContext
3. Retrieve Beans from Spring Container.

Dependency Injection:
Injection types two common: 1. Constructor Injection. 2. Setter Injection !!// treat dependency as a  helper

Setter Injection:
1. Create setter method(s) in class for injections. 2. Configure the dependency injection in Srping config file

Injecting Literal Values in class:
1. Create setter methods in class for injections.: create private fields, create setter methods.
2. Configure the injection in Spring config file.

Inject literal values from property files:
1.create properties file. 2. load properties file in spring config file. 3. reference values from properties file.
